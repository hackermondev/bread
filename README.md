# Running This On Your Bot
If you want to run this on your bot you can but you must credit me and link to the original repo. You will need ``3 enviroment variables``! ``TOKEN``: Your discord bot token which you can get from [the developer portal](https://discord.com/developers), ``MONGODB``, your mongodb url which you can get from [MongoDB Atlas](https://mongodb.com) (make sure you named the database "bread") and ``STATCORD``, your [statcord](https://statcord.com) user token. Statcord is used for analytics of the bot.
